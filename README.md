### What is corpus?
- In the Agent Developer Kit (ADK) — which is used to build Multi-Agent Systems — a corpus is essentially a structured knowledge base or collection of data sources that your agent (or multiple agents) can retrieve information from using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Think of it as the brain’s memory folder for the agent — not the model weights, but the retrievable world knowledge you explicitly connect it to.

- A corpus in ADK is a named and managed set of indexed documents, embeddings, and metadata that an agent uses for retrieval during reasoning or generation. It’s the RAG data layer that supports context grounding — the “retrieval” part of the pipeline.
